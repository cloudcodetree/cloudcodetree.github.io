// Per-reader state for AI News posts — what has been opened, what is saved.
//
// The browser talks to Supabase directly with the reader's own JWT; RLS on
// public.reader_state (migration 0005) is the whole enforcement story. There is
// no Worker hop and no service key, exactly as demo_events and profiles work.
//
// Two rules shape this module:
//
//  1. A signed-out reader must produce NO query and NO extra bytes. The
//     session probe is a synchronous localStorage check and supabase-js is
//     imported dynamically behind it, so importing this module from BlogPage
//     does not drag the auth SDK into the list page's chunk (the same reason
//     GlobalAuth loads AuthWidget with next/dynamic).
//  2. Failed reads reject and are evicted from the cache. Callers show a retry
//     notice; writes return success/failure without breaking the static page.
